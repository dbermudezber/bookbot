# BookBot
A simple Python program that analyzes novels and prints a statistical report of word and character usage.

# Description
The BookBot program is designed to read a text file of a novel, process its content, and report on statistical measures based on word count and character count, utilizing concepts such as file input/output, string manipulation, dictionaries, and sorting algorithms. This BookBot is meant to help readers gain quantitative information about writing styles and vocabulary while showcasing core Python skills. Beyond its simple functionality, the BookBot can expand by implementing complex functions, such as comparing multiple novels, generating visualized charts with the frequency of words, or integrating natural language processing techniques (NLP) to analyze literature.
